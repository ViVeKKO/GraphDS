# GraphDS

## How do we store Graph in memory ? 
1. Adjacency Matrix: Can be used only for smaller numbers of nodes
2. Adjacency List: Can be used for larger values of nodes

If the graph is weighted, use pair class to store the weights 

## How de we traverse the graph ?
1. BFS  
    TC = O(N+E)
    SC = O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N)
2. DFS
